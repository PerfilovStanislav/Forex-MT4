Metatrader server gives wrong quotes. For our tests we need true data. 
Use special script 'convert_from_MT5_to_MT4.ex5' for converting quotes from MT5 to MT4. (script uploaded here)
Put this script in YourBroker_MT5_folder\MQL5\Scripts\

instruction: 
• open mt5 of your broker
• open window with required pair (EURUSD) and timeframe (H4)
• replace script to window
• wait some minutes (script will save quotes to YourBroker_MT5_folder\MQL5\files\EURUSD_H4.csv)
• open MT4
• press F2
• find our pair (EURUSD H4)
• press import
• choose our saved file from MT5 (YourBroker_MT5_folder\MQL5\files\EURUSD_H4.csv)
• press ok

It's all... Now you can test EA with actual data
